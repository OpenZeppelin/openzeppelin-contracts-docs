OpenZeppelin can be installed directly into your existing node.js project with `npm install --save-exact openzeppelin-solidity`, but OpenZeppelin also integrates directly with [Truffle](https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle), an Ethereum development environment, which we'll use to get started.

Please install Truffle and initialize your project:

```sh
$ npm install -g truffle
$ mkdir myproject && cd myproject
$ truffle init
```

To install the OpenZeppelin library, run the following in your Solidity project root directory:
```sh
$ npm init -y
$ npm install --save-exact openzeppelin-solidity
```

**Note that OpenZeppelin only lightly follows semantic versioning.** You may encounter breaking changes upon a minor version bump. We recommend pinning the version of OpenZeppelin you use by using the `--save-exact` option.

After that, you'll get all the library's contracts in the `node_modules/openzeppelin-solidity/contracts` folder. Because Truffle and other Ethereum development toolkits understand `node_modules`, you can use the contracts in the library like so:

```js
import 'openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/ownership/Ownable.sol';

contract MyContract is Ownable {
  ...
}
```
