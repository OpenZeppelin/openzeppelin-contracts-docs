# OpenZeppelin Documentation Site Configuration

This is the Docusaurus setup for OpenZeppelin's documentation website.

Cosmetic changes to the site need to be implemented here. All of the content is
taken from the main repository [`OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity).

To run a demo of the site locally for development purposes, such as tweaking
the design, first install the dependencies with `npm install`, then start a
server with `npm start`.
